The Big-Oh of the algorithm is that the smaller number of steps necessary the amount of time taken diminishes. The program's time drastically goes down after 100 elements are loaded into an array. The time also starts off relatively high compared to the next size and then drops after the second one and then steadily goes back up against until after the 100th array size. Then the last two sizes take essentially no time at all to compute.
