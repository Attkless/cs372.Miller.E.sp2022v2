The Big-Oh of the algorithm is that the more steps required that the program has to undertake the time increases. The time that it takes to fill an array that is of size 10x10 is faster than an array that is of size 1000x1000. The larger the array and the more steps required for the array to undertake results in a longer time taken until the program is finished.
