// Assignment09.cpp : Defines the entry point for the application.
/*  (30 points) Write two functions that accepts a reference to a binary search tree as 
	input and returns a reference to a list with the items sorted in (a) ascending order,
	and (b) descending order. (HINT: traversal of the tree)
	
	(30 points) In Assignment 04, your wrote a program to keep track of the tasks you 
	needed to complete to finish an assignment. Use the C++ STL heap and priority queue
	classes to keep the list sorted in priority data. You may modify the data file to 
	include an integer priority as the last value. Modify the menu to allow the user to 
	adjust the priority of task.
